/*
The velocity and acceleration constraints were calculated based on the following equation:
((MAX_RPM / 60) * GEAR_RATIO * WHEEL_RADIUS * 2 * Math.PI) * 0.85
This is only 85% of the theoretical maximum velocity of the bot, following the recommendation above.

Maximum Angular Velocity is calculated as: maximum velocity / trackWidth * (180 / Math.PI) but capped at 360Â°/s.

This is capped at 85% because there are a number of variables that will prevent your bot from actually reaching this maximum velocity:
voltage dropping over the game, bot weight, general mechanical inefficiencies, etc.

However, you can push this higher yourself if you'd like. Perhaps raise it to 90-95% of the theoretically max velocity.
The theoretically maximum velocity is 61.74330378369762 in/s.
